# AI Usage Statement

This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.

## Tools
- ChatGPT (OpenAI): used for code suggestions, writing assistance, and English rephrasing (non-native English).
- Claude (Anthropic): used to discuss broader issues when multiple parts of the codebase were interrelated.

## How AI was used
AI assistance was used to:
- Help diagnose the origin of coding issues
- Suggest refactoring and reorganization of Python modules (structure, naming, readability)
- Draft docstrings/comments and README text
- Suggest potential fixes for errors and edge cases
- Clarify machine learning concepts not fully understood from lecture notes
- Provide multiple solution options to specific problems (final decisions were made by the author)

## Human verification
All AI-suggested changes were reviewed and validated by the author by:
- Running the full pipeline end-to-end
- Checking unit/integration tests (when available)
- Verifying that outputs, metrics, and plots were consistent with the intended methodology

## What AI did NOT do (non-exhaustive)
- AI was not used to fabricate results, metrics, or empirical findings
- AI did not originate the project idea
- AI did not make final design choices or select the final solution
- Final methodological choices and interpretations are the author’s responsibility
