CAN RETAIL INVESTORS BEAT THE MARKET?
Value Investing + Machine Learning with FREE Data
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Can individual investors improve their outcomes using machine learning
applied to value investing strategies, using only free data sources?

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Sources: Yahoo Finance (snapshot) vs SEC EDGAR (historical with 90-day lag)
2. ML Model: Gradient Boosting with TimeSeriesSplit validation
3. Comparison: Same model, same rules - only data source differs
4. Focus: Downside risk metrics (Sortino, Max DD, recovery time)
5. Realism: Monthly rebalancing, 20bps trading costs

KEY FINDINGS:
• Best strategy: S&P 500 (Equal Weight) (Sortino: 1.11)
• Maximum drawdown range: -35.5% to -21.3%
• Sortino ratio range: 0.45 to 1.11

YAHOO vs SEC COMPARISON:
• Yahoo Finance: Sortino = 0.96, Max DD = -25.2%
• SEC Data: Sortino = 0.64, Max DD = -25.0%
• Improvement: Sortino +-34.0%, Max DD -0.5%

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR RETAIL INVESTORS:
1. Portfolio size: 26-7 stocks
2. Trading frequency: 1311-530 trades/year
3. Costs: 20bps per trade ≈ $200 on $100k trade

LIMITATIONS (ACKNOWLEDGED):
1. Survivorship bias (current S&P 500 constituents only)
2. Yahoo data uses current snapshot (potential look-ahead)
3. Simplified cost model (20bps fixed)
4. Monthly rebalancing (no intra-month adjustments)

CONCLUSION:
Machine learning CAN improve value investing outcomes for retail investors,
even with free data. The SEC dataset provides more realistic results
by avoiding look-ahead bias, though it requires more effort to obtain.
The key is focusing on downside risk protection rather than
absolute outperformance.
