Finance has long been divided between two views: on the one hand, fundamental analysis, which claims that financial ratios (P/E, P/B, dividend yield, EPS) can help identify investment opportunities; on the other hand, the efficient market hypothesis, which suggests that such information is quickly reflected in prices.
Professional investors rely on expensive tools (Bloomberg, FactSet), but retail investors typically only have access to free data available on platforms such as Yahoo Finance.
The question is therefore simple: can an investor who relies only on these free fundamentals hope to outperform the market?  (I mean those free after having a computer and having access to internet)

This question becomes even more interesting when combined with behavioral finance: can psychological biases explain why some stocks appear to outperform despite weak fundamentals (Tesla, Nvidia), while others remain stable and seemingly undervalued (Nestlé, UBS)? (I might skip this part If the principal is to big )

The planned approach focuses on collecting and analyzing free financial data to explore the relationship between fundamentals and stock performance. Using yfinance, historical data (prices, P/E, P/B, dividend yield, EPS) will be retrieved for two “local/familiar” stocks (Nestlé, UBS) and two “star/attention” stocks (Tesla, Nvidia), benchmarked against the S&P 500. After preparing the dataset (cleaning, currency harmonization, computing returns and volatilities), the study will segment different market phases (calm vs. crisis periods) and examine how valuation levels relate to subsequent performance. Results will be visualized through price curves, histograms, and correlation plots.
